            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Television and theater are excellent forms of media that break down and showcase a person’s mind. How characters battle societal pressures reveals human nature. Two pieces of media achieve this effectively. Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman, both use their protagonists to represent destructive personalities, highlighting certain themes or ideas.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="explanation" class="content-section">
            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>Breaking Bad is a show that follows Walter White, a high school teacher from Albuquerque, New Mexico. When Walter discovers that he has inoperable lung cancer, he decides to produce and sell methamphetamine as a desperate attempt to secure his pregnant wife, Skyler White, and his teenage son, Walter Jr., financially.</p>
            <p>Death of a Salesman is a two-act play that follows Willy Loman, a traveling salesman in the late 1940s Brooklyn, New York. Willy, burdened with financial stress and unrealistic expectations, struggles to grasp reality as he descends into senility. Other notable characters include his wife, Linda; his two sons, Biff and Happy; and Bernard, the neighbors’ son.</p>

        <section id="psychoanalytical" class="content-section">
            <h2>Psychoanalytical Theory</h2>
            <p>Both Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman exhibit how their main characters—Willy and Walter—think with an effective degree. Their critical thinking, problem solving, and how they interpret and understand their environment is displayed to the viewer. It is an integral part that humanizes these characters. To further analyze their minds, we can use psychoanalytical theory to better understand them. Psychoanalytical theory is a framework that was developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose was to understand human behaviour. Sigmund theory insinuates that human behaviour is influenced by thoughts, urges, and unconscious memories. Psychoanalytical theory helps you grasp the inner workings of the human mind.</p> 

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Walter White Analysis</h3>

            <P>First, let’s examine Walter White. Walter’s character is broken into two personas. Walter himself and his alter ego Heisenberg. Heisenberg is Walter’s darker and ruthless persona that is driven purely by his desires and impulses.</P>
                
            <P>The transformation of Walter White into Heisenberg came from feelings of dissatisfaction and inadequacy. He decided to buyout his stake in Grey Matter Technologies, a company that he created with his friends from college, which led to feelings of regret and frustration as it later became a multibillion-dollar company. Walter works as a chemistry teacher and a car washing worker. These jobs pale in comparison to the amount of money he could have made as a co-founder at Grey Matter Technologies. This pushes the narrative of wasted potential onto Walter. Walter also finds dissatisfaction at home. Like Willy, Walter is loyal to his family, but this loyalty is what leads to his dissatisfaction. Walt feels emasculated from the humiliation that he receives from his brother-in-law Hank. Hank doesn’t consider Walt to be manly. This leads to multiple instances where Hank humiliates him in front of his family. When Walt reveals his cancer diagnosis to Hank and Maire, his Hank’s wife, they are both distraught from hearing the terrible news. While Marie starts contacting medical professionals for treatment, both Skyler and Marie leave the scene. In a moment of silence between Walt and Hank, Hank comments, “Whatever happens... I want you to know that um… I’ll always take care of your family” (“Cancer Man” 10:18–10:28), implying that Walter can’t provide for his family. Even in a moment of sadness and heartbreak, Hank unintentionally humiliates him. The lack of power, control, and recognition is where Heisenberg originated. Heisenberg filled the void that haunted Walter with a cruel, proud character driven by the need for dominance and respect.</P> 
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNVlpaufz_U?si=F-OqLzqMblvv1NWe&amp;start=235" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>    
            </div>
            <P>With proper background information on both Heisenberg and Walter White. Let’s analyze Walter’s psyche with Sigmund’s structure, which is the id, ego, and superego. The id is the instinctual desire. The id is the primitive, unconscious mind. Its intent is to satisfy basic desires, wants, and urges. The ego moderates between the id and the superego with reality. Finally, the superego punishes or condemns bad behaviour with feelings of guilt. It’s the ethical component that provides moral standards.</P>
                
            <P>Heisenberg is the representation of Walter’s id. Heisenberg was created from Walter’s desires. Heisenberg is willing to kill, manipulate, and harm others to achieve his goals. These actions are driven by egoistic ambitions that seek validation, respect, and power, something that Walter White lacks. The representation of ego is Walter himself. Walter rationalizes his criminal actions through a duty to provide for his family. This reflects the ego balancing the demands of the id and superego. The superego is the representation of Walter’s moral conscience. In the beginning of the show, Walter hesitates about violence and crime. Walter’s initial goal was to cook meth to secure his family's future financially. Unfortunately for Walter, as the show progresses, Walter’s id, Heisenberg, slowly takes over. This is because when Walter is in a difficult situation, he lets Heisenberg take over. In the episode “Say My Name”, Walter kills his own associate, Mike Ehrmantraut, out of frustration. With the DEA on their tail, Mike planned to flee Albuquerque. Walter confronts him before he leaves. Walter wanted Mike to help him shake off the DEA, but Mike refused. In a fit of rage, Heisenberg takes control to shoot Mike through his car window with a gun. Luckily, Mike was able to drive away. Unfortunately, Mike realized that his injuries were fatal and decided to exit his car to slowly die by a nearby lake. Heisenberg soon catches up with Mike. Feelings of regret wash over him as he encounters Mike dying. In this moment Walter regains control over Heisenberg and apologizes, “I’m sorry, Mike. This whole thing could have been avoided” (“Say My Name” 45:50–45:52). Choosing your impulses over your moral compass is an easy decision when you have selfish intentions.</P>

            </div>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Willy Loman Analysis</h3>

            <P>Second is Willy Loman. Willy doesn’t make enough money to sustain his family or to pay off his rampant bills. He is known to be obsessed with achieving the American Dream. Just like Walter, Willy struggles with feelings of dissatisfaction and inadequacy. Willy often hallucinates throughout the play to illustrate his struggle between reality and illusion. Near the beginning of the play, Willy and his neighbour, Charles, have trouble sleeping, so they decide to play cards in the middle of the night. The topic of Ben surfaces in their conversation. During this discussion, Willy starts to hallucinate Ben by the foyer. Willy says to Charles, “Sure, sure! If I’d gone with him to Alaska that time, everything would’ve been totally different." Charels replies, “Go on, you’d froze to death up there.” Willy replies, “What’re you talking about?” Ben interjects and says, “Opportunity is tremendous in Alaska, William. Surprised you’re not up there.” Willy replies to Ben, “Sure, tremendous” (Miller 31). This scene is a distinct example of Willy blurring the lines between reality. His hallucinations are caused by the pressure he faces to provide for his family and the disappointment he experiences when he fails to earn money as a salesman. Not only does Willy hallucinate, but he also experiences flashbacks to earlier times. Specifically, moments with his family. This is another example of the writer using Willy to illustrate his struggle between reality and illusion.</P> 
            
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp3XMJH-B00?si=kTDemtor1glql6sl&amp;start=1894" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <P>Willy experiencing these flashbacks highlights his desire to use his memories as an escape from reality. Even worse, Willy glamorizes his memories, which leads to him being more frustrated with his current life. When Willy is overwhelmed with pressure from his financial debt and how it could affect his family, his hallucinations reflect that. Willy’s hallucinations display how Willy isn’t willing to accept reality and instead escape from it, hiding his problems.</P> 
                
            <P>Unfortunately for Willy, these problems that affect his mental health led to its decline and contributed to his tragic demise as he clenched onto goals that cannot be achieved. This explanation should help us to illuminate and understand Willy Loman’s psyche.</P>
                
            <P>To delve deeper, let’s use Sigmund’s structure—id, ego, and superego—to break down Willy’s psyche into each component. Willy’s id is his instinctual desire. Willy’s motivation is achieving the American dream. This takes shape in his desires for recognition, approval, and success. Willy dreams to be a successful salesman and to be adored by his children. Near the end of the play, an emotional Biff expresses how worried he is about Willy. As Biff struggles to contain himself, he pulls away and moves upstairs. Willy says, “Isn’t that—isn't that remarkable? Biff — he likes me!” (99). Willy is ecstatic at Biff’s expression of love. Willy wants to be respected, the same desire that Walter was seeking. While Willy’s id is his main drive and focus, it often leads Willy into creating unrealistic goals and expectations. Failure to reach these goals leads to inadequacy and dissatisfaction. Willy’s id promotes his stubborn and irrational behaviour. Willy’s ego is Willy himself. It is the conscious part of his mind. Willy balances between the wishes from his id and his superego. In parallel to Walter White, Willy rationalizes his decisions by believing that everything he does is for the benefit of his family. It is a display of Willy’s internal struggle. Willy’s ego further pushes the narrative that he struggles to understand the difference between his dreams and reality. Willy’s superego is what represents his moral compass and societal expectations. This is how Willy views success. Willy’s version of success is from the standards of success set by society. Willy’s superego is the reason he feels guilt and shame when he can’t meet these standards. [Ethan put evidence here, preferably Ben] In Willy’s relentless pursuit to meet these standards, his superego punishes him with guilt whenever he fails to uphold them.</P>
                
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp3XMJH-B00?si=jxlEX8oaOUE83vWt&amp;start=7218" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>Ultimately, Willy’s destructive nature comes from a controlling id, similarly to Heisenberg, his superego that constantly keeps punishing him for failing to become successful, and in the process, overwhelms his ego.   </p>

        <section id="americanDream" class="content-section">
            <h2>American Dream</h2>
            <p>In Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman, there were two themes that they both displayed effectively through their protagonists. The American Dream and toxic masculinity. </p>
        
            <p>First, let’s begin with the American Dream. The American Dream is the ideal that every person has an equal opportunity to achieve success through hard work and determination.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Walter White's American Dream</h3>
            
            <p>Willy as a character is known to be obsessed with the American Dream, but I believe that Walter can also relate to achieving the American Dream. In Breaking Bad, Walt’s initial goal was to make enough money from selling meth to provide for his family. Although he twists and contorts this goal as the show progresses, Walter is determined to make the highest quality batch of meth there is, often belittling his competition when they can’t match his quality. In the episode “Say My Name”, Walter needs a distributor for his product. Walter and his associates meet with Declan, a potential distributer. During negotiation, Walter says, “See, my partners here tell me that you produce a meth that's 70 percent pure, if you're lucky. What I produce is 99.1% pure.” “So it’s grade school T-ball versus the New York Yankees.” (“Say My Name” 02:13-02:35). Walt knows that the hard work he pours into production earns him a higher yield. Walter is practically trying to achieve the American Dream. He is working hard and determined to achieve success.</p>
            
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEk8SJXaSn8?si=nZ8j7VWGx05VrZ18&amp;start=40" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Willy Loman's American Dream</h3>
            
            <p>Unfortunately for Willy, his version of the American Dream is distorted. Willy believes that being “Well-liked” is the key to being successful. In flashback, we see Biff and Happy playing football in their backyard. Bernard comes into the scene to warn Biff that he has to study because he heard “Mr. Birnbaum say that if you don’t start studyin’ math he’s gonna flunk you, and you won’t graduate.” After Biff leaves, Willy says that “Bernard can get the best marks in school, y’understand, but when he gets out in the business world, y’understand, you are going to be five times ahead of him. That’s why I thank Almighty God you’re both built like Adonises. Because the man who makes an appearance in the business world, the man who creates personal interest, is the man who gets ahead. Be liked and you will never want.” In other words, he believes that perception and status are requirements for success. This can be true to an extent; reputation and brand can be profitable, but this doesn’t work for anyone. Willy’s perspective is challenged when he discovers that Bernard, a person that Willy believes to be “liked but not well-liked”, is working a case in the Supreme Court as a lawyer. An achievement that most lawyers would dream of. In this scene, it is clear to Willy and to the viewer that Bernard is a successful lawyer. Bernard worked hard to achieve success instead of relying on popularity. At the end of the play, Willy sacrifices himself so that his family will collect money from his life insurance policy. This demonstrates that the American Dream turns people into commodities valued only by their financial worth.</p>
            
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp3XMJH-B00?si=IoHejljnZkc_gIMg&amp;start=1253" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>Ultimately, both Willy and Walter meet an unfortunate end in their relentless pursuit of the American Dream. Their initial drive to provide for their family is one of their biggest similarities. While Walt was more financially successful, what he was doing was highly illegal. Which led to the destruction of his whole operation. American Dream was both their initial motivation and their downfall.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="toxicMasculinity" class="content-section">
            <h2>Toxic Masculinity</h2>
            <p>Both characters are also affected by another destructive force: toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity involves adhering to traditional male stereotypes like toughness, emotional restraint, and a need for dominance. This concept can distort a person's sense of identity, forcing them to suppress vulnerabilities in favor of aggressive or controlling behaviors.</p>
        
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Walter White's Toxic Masculinity</h3>
            
            <p>Walter White's descent into Heisenberg is largely fueled by toxic masculinity. Walter often asserts his dominance over others with violence and manipulation. Walter's justification at the beginning of the series for entering the meth business was to ensure his family’s financial security after his death. However, over time, it becomes clear that his motivation shifts towards asserting his dominance. In the final episode “Felina”, Walt had been identified as Heisenberg and is now on the run. Walter breaks into a safe for Sklyer and Walt Jr. This safe house was intended for Sklyer and Walt Jr. to seek refuge from Walter. Walter finds Skyler to have their last conversation together. At the end of their conversation, Walt tells Skyler, "I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really... I was alive" (“Felina” 33:27–33:59), underlining that his actions for entering the meth business weren’t truly for his family and necessity but driven by his own desire for power and control.</p>

            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Beu8eDYc0RM?si=gvwfZ1QCecD6j-MR&amp;start=97" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>Walter, throughout the series, consistently hides his emotions behind a mask of confidence. In Season 3, Episode 1, titled "No Más.", when Skyler confronts him about his secretive behavior, Walt responds aggressively, deflecting her concerns and refusing to show any vulnerability. Walter is unable to admit to his fears and weaknesses, hiding his emotions to appear more stoic and stronger, matching the societal expectation that men must always appear strong and in control.</p>

            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PD4OxaQ1BBg?si=QlpotQrhAjvOKiAd&amp;start=34" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Willy Loman's Toxic Masculinity</h3>
            
            <p>Willy Loman, on the other hand, in Death of a Salesman, pursues dominance in a more passive form—he wants validation and respect as a salesman and father. Willy chases success to gain authority and control, believing that being “well-liked” will secure his status. In one scene, he gives Biff and Happy advice on his ideals of success after they excitedly discuss their athletic achievements. Drawing from his own beliefs about business, he tells them, “Be liked and you will never want” (21). Pushing his idealistic views of success onto his sons. However, unlike Walter, Willy’s dominance is rooted in ideals rather than overt power plays, leading him to quietly degrade those he perceives as threats to his self-image, like Biff, whom he constantly pressures to fit into his own vision of success. When Biff rejects this notion, Willy accuses him of “spiting him” and wasting his life (Act 2, p. 95), showcasing Willy’s desire to control Biff’s path to mirror his own beliefs about success and likability.</p>
            
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp3XMJH-B00?si=7EyJW8PRqq_x99J9&amp;start=1301" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>Willy also hides his vulnerabilities, refusing to acknowledge his professional failures or confront the reality of his deteriorating career. Toward the end of the play, Willy gets into a heated argument with Biff. Biff, who has come to terms with his own limitations, confronts Willy about his lifelong obsession with success and his unrealistic ideals, accusing him of living in denial. Through Biff’s self-realization, Willy’s image of himself as a respected and significant man breaks down, causing Willy to shout, “I am not a dime a dozen! I am Willy Loman, and you are Biff Loman!” (98), clinging to an illusion of importance rather than facing his lack of success. His emotional facade, however, breaks down more visibly as he becomes overwhelmed by the burden of his unfulfilled dreams and mounting pressures, seen in moments when he converses with imagined figures from his past, including his brother Ben, who represents the success he failed to achieve. Unlike Walter, whose emotional suppression contributes to his rise, Willy’s inability to face his reality leads him into a spiral of despair and delusion, culminating in his belief that he can only provide for his family by taking his own life and giving them his life insurance policy.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman are great examples of how to use your protagonists to demonstrate the human psyche under pressure. Using psychoanalytical theory, we were able to breakdown their psyches and deduce the intent behind their actions. Sigmund’s structure helped us to examine how they juggled between their desires and moral compass. This information was important to help us understand how they are used to highlight certain themes—American Dream and Toxic Masculinity—to better portray themselves. Their themes and psyche work in tandem to create divisive yet integral characters to their respective forms of media. </p>
