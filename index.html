            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Television and theater are excellent forms of media that break down and showcase a person's mind. How characters battle with societal pressures is a display of human nature. There are two pieces of media that achieve this to an effective degree. In this video, we will be comparing how Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman use their protagonists to represent destructive personalities to highlight certain themes or ideas.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="explanation" class="content-section">
            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>Breaking Bad is a show that follows Walter White, a high school teacher from Albuquerque, New Mexico. When Walter discovers that he has inoperable lung cancer, he decides to produce and sell methamphetamine as a desperate attempt to secure his pregnant wife, Skyler White, and his teenage son, Walter Jr., financially.</p>
            <p>Death of a Salesman is a two-act play that follows Willy Loman, a traveling salesman in late 1940s Brooklyn, New York. Willy, burdened with financial stress and unrealistic expectations, struggles to grasp reality as he descends into senility. Other notable characters include his wife, Linda; his two sons, Biff and Happy; and Bernard, the neighbors' son.</p>

        <section id="psychoanalytical" class="content-section">
            <h2>Psychoanalytical Theory</h2>
            <p>Both Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman exhibit how their main characters—Willy and Walter—think with an effective degree. Their critical thinking, problem-solving, and how they interpret and understand their environment is displayed to the viewer. It is an integral part that humanizes these characters. To further analyze their minds, we can use psychoanalytical theory to better understand them. Psychoanalytical theory is a framework that was developed by Sigmund Freud. Its purpose was to understand human behavior. Sigmund Freud's theory insinuates that human behavior is influenced by thoughts, urges, and unconscious memories. Psychoanalytical theory helps you grasp the inner workings of the human mind.</p> 

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Walter White Analysis</h3>

            <P>First, let’s examine Walter White. Walter’s character is broken into two personas: Walter himself and his alter ego, Heisenberg. Heisenberg is Walter’s darker and ruthless persona that is driven purely by his desires and impulses. </P>
                
            <P>The transformation of Walter White into Heisenberg came from feelings of dissatisfaction and inadequacy. He decided to buy out his stake from Grey Matter Technologies, a company that he created with his friends from college, which led to feelings of regret and frustration, as it later became a multibillion-dollar company. Walter works as a chemistry teacher and a car wash worker. These jobs pale in comparison to the amount of money he could have made as a co-founder at Grey Matter Technologies. This pushes the narrative of wasted potential onto Walter. Walter also finds dissatisfaction at home. Like Willy, Walter is loyal to his family, but this loyalty is what led to his dissatisfaction. Walt feels emasculated by the humiliation he receives from his brother-in-law, Hank, who doesn’t consider Walt to be manly. This leads to multiple instances where Hank humiliates him in front of his family. When Walt reveals his cancer diagnosis to Hank and Marie, Hank’s wife, they are both distraught. While Marie starts contacting medical professionals for treatment, both Skyler and Marie exit the scene. In a moment of silence between Walt and Hank, Hank comments, “Whatever happens… I want you to know that, um… I’ll always take care of your family” (“Cancer Man”), implying that Walter can’t provide for his family. Even in a moment of sadness and heartbreak, Hank unintentionally humiliates him. This lack of power, control, and recognition is where Heisenberg originated. Heisenberg filled the void that haunted Walter with a cruel, proud character driven by the need for dominance and respect.</P> 
                
            <P>With proper background information on both Heisenberg and Walter White, let’s analyze Walter’s psyche with Freud’s structure: the id, ego, and superego. The id is the instinctual desires—the primitive, unconscious mind, intent on satisfying basic wants and urges. The ego moderates between the id and the superego with reality. Finally, the superego punishes or condemns bad behavior with feelings of guilt. It’s the ethical component that provides moral standards. </P>
                
            <P>Heisenberg is the representation of Walter’s id, created from Walter’s desires. Heisenberg is willing to kill, manipulate, and harm others to achieve his goals. These actions are driven by egoistic ambitions that seek validation, respect, and power, something Walter White lacks. The representation of the ego is Walter himself, as he rationalizes his criminal actions through a duty to provide for his family. This reflects the ego balancing the demands of the id and superego. The superego represents Walter’s moral conscience. At the beginning of the show, Walter hesitates about violence and crime. His initial goal was to cook meth to secure his family’s future financially. Unfortunately for Walter, as the show progresses, Walter’s id—Heisenberg—slowly takes over. This is because, in difficult situations, Walter lets Heisenberg take over. In the episode “Say My Name,” Walter kills his own associate, Mike Ehrmantraut, out of frustration. With the DEA on their tail, Mike planned to flee Albuquerque. Walter confronts him before he leaves, wanting Mike to help him shake off the DEA, but Mike refuses. In a fit of rage, Heisenberg takes control and shoots Mike through his car window. Mike realizes his injuries are fatal and decides to die by a nearby lake. Heisenberg soon catches up, and feelings of regret wash over Walter as he encounters Mike dying. In this moment, Walter regains control over Heisenberg and apologizes: “I’m sorry, Mike. This whole thing could have been avoided” (45:50–45:52). Choosing your impulses over your moral compass is an easy decision when you have selfish intentions. </P>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Willy Loman Analysis</h3>

            <P>Second is Willy Loman. Willy doesn’t make enough money to sustain his family or pay off his rampant bills. He is known to be obsessed with achieving the American Dream. Just like Walter, Willy struggles with feelings of dissatisfaction and inadequacy. Willy often hallucinates throughout the play, illustrating his struggle between reality and illusion. Near the beginning of the play, Willy and his neighbor, Charley, have trouble sleeping and decide to play cards in the middle of the night. The topic of Ben surfaces in their conversation, and Willy starts to hallucinate, seeing Ben by the foyer. Willy says to Charley, “Sure, sure! If I’d gone with him to Alaska that time, everything would’ve been totally different.” Charley replies, “Go on, you’d froze to death up there.” Willy replies, “What’re you talking about?” Ben interjects and says, “Opportunity is tremendous in Alaska, William. Surprised you’re not up there.” Willy replies to Ben, “Sure, tremendous” (Miller 31). This scene is a distinct example of Willy blurring the lines of reality. The cause of his hallucinations is the pressure he faces to provide for his family and the disappointment he experiences when he fails to earn money as a salesman. Willy also experiences flashbacks to earlier times, specifically moments with his family, as another way the writer illustrates Willy’s struggle between reality and illusion.</P> 
                
            <P>Willy’s flashbacks highlight his desire to use memories as an escape from reality. Worse, Willy glamorizes his memories, leading to even more frustration with his current life. When Willy is overwhelmed with pressure from financial debt and how it could affect his family, his hallucinations reflect that. Willy’s hallucinations display his unwillingness to accept reality, preferring instead to escape from it and hide his problems.</P> 
                
            <P>Unfortunately for Willy, these mental health struggles contribute to his tragic demise as he clings to goals that cannot be achieved. This explanation should help illuminate and clarify Willy Loman’s psyche. </P>
                
            <P>To delve deeper, let’s use Freud’s structure—id, ego, and superego—to break down Willy’s psyche into each component. Willy’s id is his instinctual desire to achieve the American Dream, taking shape in his desires for recognition, approval, and success. Willy dreams of being a successful salesman and of being adored by his children. Near the end of the play, an emotional Biff expresses his worries about Willy, struggling to contain himself before pulling away and moving upstairs. Willy exclaims, “Isn’t that—isn’t that remarkable? Biff—he likes me!” (99). Willy is ecstatic at Biff’s expression of love, as he desires respect, a sentiment also central to Walter’s character. However, Willy’s id often leads him to create unrealistic goals and expectations, and failure to reach these goals leads to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction, promoting his stubborn and irrational behavior. </P>
                
            <p>Willy’s ego is Willy himself—the conscious part of his mind that balances between the wishes from his id and his superego. Parallel to Walter White, Willy rationalizes his decisions by believing everything he does is for the benefit of his family, displaying his internal struggle. Willy’s ego further pushes the narrative of his struggle to understand the difference between his dreams and reality. </p>
                
            <p>Willy’s superego represents his moral compass and societal expectations, particularly how he views success. Willy’s version of success is based on societal standards. His superego is the reason he feels guilt and shame when he can’t meet these standards. In Willy’s relentless pursuit to meet them, his superego punishes him with guilt whenever he fails. Ultimately, Willy’s destructive nature comes from a controlling id, similarly to Heisenberg, and a superego that constantly punishes him for failing to become successful, overwhelming his ego.</p>

        <section id="americanDream" class="content-section">
            <h2>American Dream</h2>
            <p>With a deeper understanding of both characters' psyches, how are they used to highlight certain themes or ideas? In Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman, two themes that they both display effectively through their protagonists are the American Dream and toxic masculinity.</p>
        
            <p>First, let's begin with the American Dream, the ideal that every person has an equal opportunity to succeed. The American Dream means different things to different people, but generally, it represents success and happiness, a path that leads to prosperity and fulfillment. Both Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman illustrate the consequences of pursuing the American Dream, using Walter White and Willy Loman's obsession with success to show its darker side.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Walter White's American Dream</h3>
            
            <p>The American Dream's idea of success and social validation is a driving force in Walter White's life. Walter White's concept of the American Dream revolves around self-made wealth, respect, and power. He doesn't just want to make money for his family; he wants to be recognized and remembered. This ambition starts out as a quest for financial security but gradually evolves into an intense hunger for power and dominance. In his attempt to secure the American Dream, Walter goes from a meek, downtrodden teacher to a feared drug kingpin. This pursuit of success at all costs reflects the corruption of the American Dream. Walter's relentless drive for power and status shows how ambition, when untethered, can transform into greed and entitlement.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Willy Loman's American Dream</h3>
            
            <p>Willy Loman's American Dream is more about reputation and social standing than financial gain alone. He believes that being "well-liked" and admired is key to success, a belief that has shaped his entire life. Willy's version of the American Dream is grounded in the idea that charm and popularity are as essential to success as hard work. Throughout the play, Willy repeatedly tells his sons that if they are "well-liked," they will be successful. This belief blinds him to the fact that he's losing his job and has little actual financial security. Willy clings to the idea that superficial qualities like charisma are enough to achieve success, and he overlooks his sons' actual needs and talents.</p>
            
            <p>Both Walter and Willy demonstrate how the American Dream can become toxic when it transforms from a dream of opportunity to an obsessive desire for status. This obsession causes both characters to prioritize their egos and ambitions over the well-being of their families. Walter's and Willy's devotion to the American Dream ultimately harms their relationships and erodes their sense of self. By pursuing an idealized vision of success, they lose touch with the original, more innocent goals they had for themselves and their families.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="toxicMasculinity" class="content-section">
            <h2>Toxic Masculinity</h2>
            <p>Both characters are also affected by another destructive force: toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity involves adhering to traditional male stereotypes like toughness, emotional restraint, and a need for dominance. This concept can distort a person's sense of identity, forcing them to suppress vulnerabilities in favor of aggressive or controlling behaviors.</p>
        
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Walter White's Toxic Masculinity</h3>
            
            <p>Walter White's descent into Heisenberg is largely fueled by toxic masculinity. Feeling inadequate as a teacher and emasculated by his financial dependence, Walter compensates by asserting dominance in the drug world. When he first enters the meth business, he claims it's to provide for his family, but over time, it becomes clear he's driven by ego. The success of Heisenberg gives him a newfound sense of power and control, something he lacked in his life as a teacher. His transformation embodies toxic masculinity, as he sacrifices moral integrity and justifies increasingly violent acts to maintain his status.</p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Willy Loman's Toxic Masculinity</h3>
            
            <p>Willy Loman's toxic masculinity manifests in his stubborn pride and refusal to accept help. He constantly upholds his image as a proud, independent man, despite being unable to fulfill his financial obligations. He often dismisses his own insecurities by belittling others and refuses help even when he desperately needs it. Willy's fragile ego and need for control push him to make reckless decisions that further damage his relationship with his family.</p>
            
            <p>The toxic masculinity in both characters ultimately contributes to their downfall. Walter's identity as Heisenberg drives him deeper into crime, alienating him from his family and turning him into someone they can't recognize. Willy's pride and need for validation lead him into a tragic spiral of denial and self-destruction. Both Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman use toxic masculinity to illustrate the dangers of societal expectations and the pressures of conforming to rigid gender roles.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" class="content-section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman, we witness two men whose lives are destroyed by a pursuit of ideals that society has conditioned them to desire. Walter White's transformation into Heisenberg and Willy Loman's tragic spiral are cautionary tales of how the American Dream, combined with toxic masculinity, can warp a person's sense of self and lead to their downfall.</p>
        
            <p>These stories serve as reflections on the dangers of unchecked ambition and societal pressure. Ultimately, both Breaking Bad and Death of a Salesman encourage audiences to question what they are willing to sacrifice for success and whether the dreams they are chasing are truly their own or merely illusions imposed by society.</p>
